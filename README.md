Welcome to my game!

Character Selection:
	You can play this game using the default character, or select a different character using the dropdown box at the top of the page.


Starting the game:

	To run the game, open the index.html file in your browser.

Object of the game:

	Get your player safely across the sidewalk and into the water.  (It's hot outside
	and your hero needs to cool off!)

	Earn points along the way and try to get more points than your little brother.  That will
	give him another reason to look up to you.  :)

How to play:

	Use the right, left, up, down arrow keys on a standard keyboard to move the player around 
	on the screen.

	Navigate your player across avoiding all the bugs.  Fortunately, like lemmings, these 
	guys only go one direction.  Unfortunately, as you increase in levels, the number of 
	bugs increase and so does their max speed, so watch out!

	As you move your player, you will find treasures along the way.
		Gemstones: These increase your point value.
			Blue - Plus 500 points
			Orange - Plus 1000 points
			Green - Plus 1500 points
		
		Heart: Get an extra life plus 2000 points
		
		Key: Plus 3000 points.  When you collect 5, you also go up a level.  When that 
		happens, the key count gets reset back to 0.
		
		Star: New Level and 10,000 points 

		Bugspray: No points but it automatically eliminates one bug!

To reset the game, refresh your browser.

Have fun!
